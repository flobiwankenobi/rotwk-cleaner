‚öîÔ∏è Deletes unnecessary configuration files to get a clean config directory to avoid the game to get out of synch

In detail, rotwk-cleaner will delete all files in your %appdata% config directory of The Rise of the Witch-king with but will __keep__ your savegames, heroes, custom maps and replays.

I'm not üíØ percent sure if that solves the problem, but we have had less problems with out of synchs since then.


## How to use
1. Download the latest executable from https://github.com/flobiwankenobi/rotwk-cleaner/releases
2. Execute the file
3. If SmartScreen blocks the file, press "More Info" and then "Run anyway"
4. Press Yes if you get asked to clean up your rotwk directory
5. Press OK to confirm
6. Enjoy!
